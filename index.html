      <h2> Project Description </h2>
      <p> This project will focus on training a neural network to take in an image and return a generated meme with that image. The network will be trained with a curated data set of memes, separated into images and captions. We will be able to separate image from caption by using previously existing programs and specific formats for the memes (image with caption in above/below whitespace). </p>
      <p> If this is fairly simple, I would like to try training the neural network to produce meme captions that are convincingly human-generated. That is, the memes seem to be created by humans. I would like to do this by having another neural network that is trained to identify if a meme is "real," then using generative adversarial networks to attempt to produce "real" memes.
	
      <h2> Project Goals </h2>
      <p> The goals of this project are to: (1) Create a data set of meme images and captions for training the neural network; (2) Train a neural network to recognize "real" memes; (3) Train the first neural network to produce "real" memes that seem to be created by a human.</p>
